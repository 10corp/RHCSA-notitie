# Create, delete, and modify local user accounts
## 3.2. USING THE USER MANAGER TOOL
The User utility allows you to view, modify, add, and delete local users in the graphical user interface.

### 3.2.1. Viewing Users and Groups
Press the <kbd>Super</kbd> key to enter the Activities Overview, type Users and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The Users utility appears. The <kbd>Super</kbd> key appears in a variety of guises, depending on the keyboard and other hardware, but often as either the Windows or Command key, and typically to the left of the Spacebar.
To make changes to the user accounts first select the **Unlock** button and authenticate yourself as indicated by the dialog box that appears. Note that unless you have superuser privileges, the application will prompt you to authenticate as root. To add and remove users select the + and - button respectively. To edit a users language setting, select the language and a drop-down menu appears.
